# â—Ž 3D Print Designs

This is a collection of various 3D designs I have created to suit various needs and purposes. These are specific to me and you likely won't find much use for this, so this repo is mostly to display my work in this area.


## 4mm Bit Driver

![bit driver](/images/hex-bit-driver.png)

Simple, ultra small 4mm bit driver. Can accomodate any 4mm hex bit, but doubles in utility if you use a [double-sided 4mm hex bit](https://www.swissknifeshop.com/products/swiss-army-cybertool-bit-4mm-flathead-2-phillips) from Victorinox. The keychain hole doubles as a bit driver, as well. A bit can be inserted there and the handle provides lateral torque for greater strength.

## Penetration Testing / SERE Card Case

A credit card sized ID/badge card holder with many surprises underneath. The idea was to create an inconspicuous ID badge holder with enough room for an extra card or two that conceal a panoply of hacker tools, penetration testing tools, and [SERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape) tools. 

I iterated over the design multiple times in order to fit as much as possible into the design as well as customizing it heavily to suit my own needs. The kit includes space for USB-C and Micro-USB adapters, small flash drives, an SD Card (or SD Adapter), a [D.I.Y. RubberDucky](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/17/diy-rubber-ducky-is-as-cheap-as-its-namesake/) made with a [Digispark Attiny 85](https://infosecwriteups.com/make-usb-rubber-ducky-with-less-than-3-fa72dac9e4de), a general purpose space for lockpicks and shims, a cermic razor blade for stripping wires, a [Delta handcuff key](https://www.handcuffwarehouse.com/delta-handcuff-key/), a 1" glow stick emergency light source, and much more.

Everything is nice and stable when one or two cards are slid over the contents. I also keep a one-page [linux hacking cheat sheet](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/Hacking_Tools_Cheat_Sheet), a NATO phonetic alphabet and morse code cheet sheat, and a tiny paper ruler all folded up and secured with a rubber band around the case.

## Packable Micro Toothbrush

![packable micro toothbrush](/images/micro%20toothbrush.png)

I like to travel but I don't like packing a lot, at all. I like to conduct travel experiments and see how much I can get away with not bringing or find ways I can cleverly pack very minimally while not sacrificing functionality. Full-sized toothbrushes are long and rigid, making them inconvenient to pack in small bundles. Further, methods for covering them to protect them from microbes can also become cumbersome. 

I designed this ultra micro travel toothbrush handle to work with all Braun and Oral-B compatible electric toothbrush heads:

The handle has a hollow center that can be used to store dental floss, toothpaste stored in a sealed drinking straw, or other even tooth powders for brushing instead of paste.

## Packable Micro Razor Handle

![packable razor handle](/images/packable-razor.png)

Similar to the packable micro toothbrush, I wanted a shaving kit that I could fit into an Atloids tin-sized all-in-one toiletry kit. I design this micro razor handle that accepts Gillette brand razor heads. It's tiny, providing just enough of a handle to comfortably grip while shaving. The blades press fit onto the head and are held firmly in place.

## Magnet Keychain

![magnet keychain](/images/micro-magnet-keychain.png)

Tiny keychain with a depression to glue in a 10mm neodymium magnet. The motivation was to have a magnet always at the ready to test if certain metals are ferrous or not. The specific motivation came to me when shopping for steel cookware, where a magnet would have been useful in determining what was steel and what was aluminum.

## Stereo Cutter Head for Record Lathe

![record lathe cutter head](/images/lathe-cutter-head.jpg)

[Lathe-cut records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_cutting_lathe) are an interest to me and I've been slowly building my own D.I.Y. record cutter for a couple of years. This is a prototype "head" for the cutter which houses two 40mm resonant surface drivers that actuate the cutting stylus. There are threaded insert holes in the top to mount a DB-9 connector for various other connections on the head other than the audio signal source: stylus heating wire, inductive distance sensor, etc.

Resonant surface exciter:

## Tape And Thread Spool Keychain

I wanted a keychain-capable spool to contain some standard 2" duct tape with a hollow core to house some sewing needles, along with a thread spool endcap. Together, the keychain allows me to carry tape and thread for repairing various things on the fly: clothes, fabrics, ductwork, the one-billion applications for duct tape, etc.
